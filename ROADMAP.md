# Roadmap

## Proven
- P1 expression engine · P2 damage model · P3 D4-as-config · P4 parity
  proof (7 real builds identical through diablo4-calc's native engine and
  rtce — the standing numbers 8,096.02 … 6,769.10) · **P4c diablo4-calc
  switchover** — native `calc.rs`/`stats.rs` math deleted, `calc::evaluate`
  is a Breakdown shim over `rtce_adapter` + the compiled `gamedef/`
  stage objectives, WASM/web re-verified at 8,096.02 (rtce proven on
  wasm32, not just native), consumer's full suite (120 tests/21 suites)
  green.
- **Maturation** (before any announcement) — explain() per-stage traces;
  P5 search module (Move, batch pricing, top-K/Pareto); rustdoc pass
  (`#![warn(missing_docs)]` clean, crate-level doctest); a runnable
  `examples/your_own_game.rs` walkthrough; MIT OR Apache-2.0 licensing
  with crates.io-ready package metadata (`cargo publish --dry-run`
  clean for both crates); GitHub Actions CI (test + clippy + fmt).

## Next
- [ ] Publish: GitHub repo, then crates.io (`rtce`, `rtce-testkit`) — the
      API survived the P4c switchover; semver honesty: 0.x until publish.
      Publish `rtce-testkit` first (no rtce-workspace deps of its own);
      once it exists on crates.io, consider pinning
      `rtce-testkit = { path = ..., version = "0.1.0" }` as rtce's
      dev-dependency so `cargo test` also builds from the published
      tarball (path-only today because that version pin can't resolve
      against the registry before the first real publish).

## Explicitly out of scope
- Knowledge-graph construction (external drivers).
- Level-2 timeline simulation until Level-1 proves the shape (P6).
